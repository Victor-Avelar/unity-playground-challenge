Create a game based on Unity Playground.
Requirements:
- No violence
- Multiplayer cooperative on same keyboard where players have different abilities / roles
- 3 levels (or endless)
- No external assets – using only assets from Playground. You can combine them with basic Unity objects
Evaluation Criteria:
Ease of play –playable with no instructions (on screen text or limited intro text is OK)
Interdependency – neither player should be able to advance or win by themselves
Execution – Looks and feels like a game, sufficiently different from examples
Creativity – Unique is good, as long as it is executed well
